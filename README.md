The problem is described below:

The client wants a computer chess tutor program that can teach chessto students. They require a fully fleshed graphical user interface program.
When the program starts, the board should be empty and all the participating pieces (King,Queen, Rook, Night, Bishop, and Pawn) should be placed outside the board. 
The user should be able to choose a piece to place on the board. 
This can be achieved by either dragging the piece into the board at the desired point or clicking a piece then clicking the location where the user desires. 
The program should have a way of indicating which piece is on the board, either by removing it from the list of pieces outside the board or simply highlighting it. 
When the piece is placed on the board, the program should automatically highlight all its correct next possible moves. 
The user should be able to click or drag the piece to the next valid position. 
If the position is invalid, the program should indicate that to the user and refuse to move. 
If it is valid, the piece should move and the program should indicate a new set of valid moves by highlighting them. 
The previous valid movesshould disappear from the board when displaying a new set of valid moves. 
When the user is satisfied, he/she should remove the piece from the board, and place a new type of piece
